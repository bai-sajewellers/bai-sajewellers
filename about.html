            <br>
            <p>When history's most eminent kings & queens such as <strong>Maharana Pratap Singh, Maharaja Suraj Mal and Maharani Gayatri Devi</strong> etc. used to rule the western region of India, only a few handful of goldsmiths with years of experience were allowed to craft their jewelleries. Our fore-fathers were one of those choosen ones.
                <br>
                <br>
               With the passage of time, people started to recall the glorious and royal past of those rulers as <strong>The Rajwadi Era</strong>.
